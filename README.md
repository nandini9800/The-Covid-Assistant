# The-Covid-Assistant
The project aims to help the patients, who are under home isolation by monitoring their health everyday and suggesting them the right care. Also our project aims to develop a system using which the government or the right authorities can determine, whom two vaccinate first in the order of priority and whom next. We would be asking the patients for their health conditionâ€™s index ,Death Rate of a locality , their age group etc. for coming up with a priority index based on which they will be given a sequence of their vaccination order. For the home assistance to the patients at self-isolation at homes we would be asking the patient to input their pulse rate , temperature etc to recommend them the right medicines and the necessary steps to be taken while staying at home Also it would alarm the patient when the health deteriorates severely.
